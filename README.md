LIWCalike: an R implementation of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Built on the quanteda package for text analysis, LIWCalikes provides a
simple interface to the analysis of text by counting words and other
textual features, including the application of a dictionary to produce a
tabular report of percentages. This provides similar functionality to
the LIWC stand-alone software.

The user must supply a dictionary, which can include one of the custom
LIWC dictionaries if these have been purchased from
<http://liwc.wpengine.com>, or any other dictionary supplied by the
user. The `dictionary()` constructor of the **quanteda** package, on
which **LIWCalike** is built, can read both LIWC and Wordstat-formatted
dictionary files, or you can use it to create a dictionary from an R
list object (a named list of character vectors, where each character
vector is a set of dictionary match patterns and its associated name is
the dictionary key).

### Differences from the LIWC standalone software

This package is designed for R users and those wishing to build
functionality by extending the
[**quanteda**](https://github.com/kbenoit/quanteda) package for text
analysis. If you prefer to have a complete, stand-alone user interface,
then you should purchase and use the [LIWC standalone
software](http://liwc.wpengine.com). This has several advantages:

-   LIWC allows direct importing of files, including binary (Word, pdf,
    etc) formats. To use **LIWCalike**, you will need to import these
    into the **quanteda** package first.  
    **LIWCalike** also works fine with simple character vectors, if you
    prefer to use standard R methods to create your input object (e.g.
    `readLines()`, `read.csv()`, etc.)

-   LIWC provides direct outputs in the form of csv, Excel files, etc.
    By contrast, **LIWCalike** returns a `data.frame`, which you have to
    export yourself (e.g. using `write.csv()`.)

-   LIWC provides easy segmentation, through a GUI. By contrast, with
    **LIWCalike** you will have to segment the texts yourself.
    (**quanteda** provides easy ways to do this using `segment()` and
    `changeunits()`.)

-   LIWC color codes the dictionary value matches in your texts and
    displays these in a nice graphical window.

-   LIWC provides four composite measures that are not included in
    **LIWCalike**: “Analytic”, “Clout”, “Authentic”, and “Tone”. These
    are based on proprietary algorithms, as described and refernced in
    [Pennebaker, J.W., Boyd, R.L., Jordan, K., & Blackburn, K. (2015).

Using dictionaries with LIWCalike
---------------------------------

No dictionaries are supplied with **LIWCalike**, it is up to you to
supply these. With the **quanteda** functions for creating or importing
dictionaries, however, this is quite easy.

With the LIWC 2007, external dictionaries were distributed with the
software that could be used in the format read by Provalis Research’s
[*Wordstat*](http://provalisresearch.com/products/content-analysis-software/).
Because I purchases a license for this product, I have that file and can
use it with **LIWCalike**.

Using it is quite straightforward:

How to Install
--------------

**LIWCalike** is currently only available on GitHub, not on CRAN. The
best method of installing it is through the **devtools** package:

    devtools::install_github("kbenoit/LIWCalike")

This will also automatically install the **quanteda** package on which
**LIWCalike** is built.
